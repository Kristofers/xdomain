xdomain
=======

A simple way to share cookies cross domain. This simple solution requires iframe support in browser.


1. put xdomain.js somewhere accessible for all domains.
2. include script on page that will initialize sharing of cookies.

TODO
make it more generic by adding configuration array in to thats defines all shared cookie names
